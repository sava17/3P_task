The significant and noteworthy differences between the two sets of documents.

The primary difference lies in the **legal understanding of Danish Building Regulations (BR18) regarding Fire Class 1 (BK1)**. The "Without Knowledge" version makes a fundamental assumption that a certified fire consultant is required, whereas the "With Knowledge" version correctly identifies that BK1 allows the building owner to take responsibility without a certified consultant.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the differences:

### 1. Requirement for a Certified Fire Consultant (Crucial Difference)
*   **Without Knowledge:**
    *   The document acts as if a **certified fire consultant is mandatory**.
    *   It explicitly includes a section for "Erklæring fra certificeret brandrådgiver" (Declaration from certified fire consultant).
    *   It requires the consultant's certificate number and signature.
*   **With Knowledge:**
    *   It correctly identifies the exemption for Brandklasse 1 (BK1).
    *   It states: *"For Brandklasse 1 er en certificeret brandrådgiver ikke et krav, men bygherre er ansvarlig"* (For Fire Class 1, a certified fire consultant is not a requirement, but the client is responsible).
    *   The signature block allows for the **Bygherre (Client/Owner)** to sign off on the safety measures, which is legally accurate for this specific class of building in Denmark.

### 2. Regulatory References (Paragraphs)
*   **Without Knowledge:**
    *   References **§ 150, § 151, § 152** (General administrative provisions regarding building permits).
    *   While not entirely wrong in a general sense, these are not the specific paragraphs governing the *Starterklæring* for fire.
*   **With Knowledge:**
    *   References **§ 508** (Specific requirements for the Starterklæring).
    *   References **§ 511** (Placement in fire classes).
    *   References **§ 510** (Tactical rescue operations).
    *   This demonstrates a much deeper understanding of **BR18 Chapter 5 (Brand)** rather than just the general administrative chapters.

### 3. Document Structure and Format
*   **Without Knowledge:**
    *   Written as a narrative or a letter. It uses prose to describe the project and the compliance.
    *   The "Control Plan" section describes *what* will happen in the future.
*   **With Knowledge:**
    *   Formatted as a **technical checklist/form**. This closely mimics the actual digital forms or standard templates used by professionals in Denmark.
    *   It uses a matrix (a1, a2, b1, b2) to assign responsibility for specific documents (START, ITT, DBK, BS), which is a standard industry methodology for defining the scope of work.

### 4. Technical Specifications (ITT Document)
*   **Without Knowledge:**
    *   Lists the required driveway width as **3.5 meters** (a standard road width rule).
    *   Lists the required load capacity as **18 tons**.
*   **With Knowledge:**
    *   Lists the driveway width as **3.0 meters**.
    *   Explicitly mentions **"Aarhus Kommunes anbefalinger"** (Aarhus Municipality recommendations). This suggests the "With Knowledge" model is aware of local municipal nuances that may differ slightly from, or clarify, the national standard.

### Summary
The **"Without Knowledge"** output created a generic, safe, but slightly legally inaccurate document (by over-prescribing a certified consultant).

The **"With Knowledge"** output created a highly specific, legally accurate document that recognized the specific exemption for small garages (BK1) and used the correct statutory paragraph references (§508 vs §150).
